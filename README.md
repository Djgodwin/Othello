# Othello Project
An implementation of the board game Othello (also called Reversi), in which a human player can play against an A.I. player. The  

The Othello.jar is runnable with JRE 1.8+.

## Description and Rules of Reversi/Othello
According to the Wikipedia page:
>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called    disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with      their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk      just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. Players take alternate turns. If one player can not make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends.

## How to Use the Program
The game is played via console commands. When the executable runs, the user selects which color to play as (the A.I. uses the color that was not selected). A representation of the game board is displayed using text characters, with 'W' representing the color white, 'B' representing the color black, and '*' representing an unfilled space. Pieces are placed using a numberic coordinate system.

Note: In this project, the game is played on a 6x6 board. This was done to increase computation efficiency and reduce the testing time.
